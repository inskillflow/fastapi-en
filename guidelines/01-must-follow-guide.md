## 1) Overview

This roadmap is designed to guide you through a complete and practical FastAPI learning sequence.

You will progressively move through the following stages:

- understanding the framework,
- exploring a simple API example,
- learning how to test APIs properly,
- practicing through a quiz,
- analyzing a real FastAPI project,
- building your own API,
- creating its front-end,
- and continuing with a larger project afterward.

This structure is intended to help you move from guided learning to autonomous development in a clear and efficient way.

<a id="section-2"></a>

## 2) Important Before You Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This roadmap is built around **progressive understanding through practice**.
>  
> It is strongly recommended to:
> - read the materials in order,
> - study the demo project carefully,
> - reuse existing patterns intelligently,
> - and avoid starting from scratch when a solid reference already exists.
>
> The goal is not to reinvent everything.  
> The goal is to **understand, adapt, build, and deliver**.

> [!TIP]
> Read the full conceptual document first whenever possible.  
> When time is limited, jump directly to the hands-on project and study the code through practice.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-3"></a>

## 3) Main Repository

Start with the main repository:

[FastAPI-EN — Complete Repository](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN)

This repository contains the learning materials, practical examples, testing guides, and project-oriented resources used throughout this roadmap.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-4"></a>

## 4) Step 1 — Understand FastAPI

Begin with this introductory document:

[00 — What is FastAPI](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/00-What-is-FastAPI.md)

This document helps establish the essential foundation:

- what FastAPI is,
- why it is useful,
- how it simplifies API development,
- and why it is well suited for modern backend systems.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-5"></a>

## 5) Step 2 — Review a Simple Example

Continue with this simple calculator API example:

[01 — FastAPI Calculator API with Swagger UI](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/01-FastAPI-Calculator-API-with-Swagger-UI.md)

This example is useful for understanding:

- the structure of a small FastAPI application,
- how endpoints are defined,
- how the application runs,
- and how Swagger UI is used for testing.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-6"></a>

## 6) Step 3 — Read the Main Document

It is strongly recommended to read the following document completely:

[05 — FastAPI APIs: From Concepts to Implementation](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/05-FastAPI-APIs-From-Concepts-to-Implementation.md)

This is one of the most important resources in the sequence because it connects theory, design logic, and implementation.

### Short on time? Jump to the hands-on project

Go directly to **Point 15**:

**15 — Hands-on Project — Task Manager API (FastAPI + Streamlit)**

Clone the project with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app.git
````

This project is an excellent reference for understanding how a complete FastAPI application can be structured and connected to a simple user interface.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-7"></a>

## 7) Step 4 — Learn How to Test an API

To understand how to test an API step by step, read:

[16 — How to Test Your API with Swagger UI — Step by Step for Absolute Beginners](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/16-FastAPI-main-py-Explained-Line-by-Line.md)

This resource helps clarify the practical testing process:

* open Swagger UI,
* choose an endpoint,
* provide input values,
* execute the request,
* inspect the response,
* and understand what the API returns.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-8"></a>

## 8) Step 5 — Complete Testing Guide

For more complete testing, use this guide:

[06 — FastAPI Method 1: Swagger UI + REST Client — Practical Testing Guide](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/06-FastAPI-Method-1-Swagger-UI-REST-Client-Practical-Testing-Guide.md)

This document is important for learning how to test APIs in a more structured and disciplined way.

### Other optional testing methods

Documents **07, 08, 09, and 10** introduce additional testing approaches:

* `curl`
* **REST Client** in VS Code
* **Postman**

You may use the method that fits your workflow best.

> [!NOTE]
> The tool can change.
> The real objective is to understand requests, responses, status codes, parameters, and testing logic clearly.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-9"></a>

## 9) Step 6 — Practice Quiz

Practice with this quiz:

[01 — Quiz: API Testing with FastAPI](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app/blob/main/01-Quiz-API-Testing-with-FastAPI.md)

This quiz is useful for checking your understanding before moving into project work.

### Answer key

[02 — Answers: Quiz API Testing with FastAPI](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app/blob/main/02-Answers-Quiz-API-Testing-with-FastAPI.md)

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-10"></a>

## 10) Step 7 — Understand `main.py` Line by Line

To understand how a FastAPI application is built in detail, read:

[16 — FastAPI main.py Explained Line by Line](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/16-FastAPI-main-py-Explained-Line-by-Line.md)

This document is especially useful for understanding:

* `Pydantic`,
* route definitions,
* request handling,
* response structure,
* and the internal organization of a FastAPI project.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-11"></a>

## 11) Step 8 — Evaluation 2: Build Your Own API

It is now time to build your own API.

Instructions:

[06 — FastAPI Method 1: Swagger UI + REST Client — Practical Testing Guide](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/06-FastAPI-Method-1-Swagger-UI-REST-Client-Practical-Testing-Guide.md)

Use the analyzed project as inspiration and adapt it intelligently.

Examples of possible changes:

* change the domain,
* modify the resource names,
* redesign the endpoints,
* update the logic,
* adapt the project to a different context.

### Reference project

[demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app/tree/main)

> [!TIP]
> Do not waste time trying to invent a completely new structure.
> Start from a working model, understand it, and customize it.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

<a id="section-12"></a>

## 12) Step 9 — Analyze the Front-End of the Demo Project

Study the demo project:

[demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app)

Then review the front-end file:

[frontend.py](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app/blob/main/frontend.py)

This part helps you understand how a front-end can interact with a FastAPI backend and prepares you for the next evaluation.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

---

<a id="section-13"></a>

## 13) Step 10 — Evaluation 3: Build the Front-End for Your API

After building your API, your next task is to build its front-end.

Assignment:

[18 — FastAPI Evaluation 2: Build a Complete REST API](https://github.com/inskillflow/FastAPI-EN/blob/main/18-FastAPI-Evaluation-2-Build-a-Complete-REST-API.md)

### Project inspiration

Use the class project as a reference:

* [Demo project](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app)
* [frontend.py](https://github.com/inskillflow/demo_api_1_simple_fastapi_app/blob/main/frontend.py)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reuse what you already understand.
> Build with intention.
> Keep the structure clean, readable, and consistent with the backend you created.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

<a id="section-14"></a>

## 14) Step 11 — Next Project

After completing the previous stages, continue with the next project:

[iris-ai-platform](https://github.com/inskillflow/iris-ai-platform)

This project represents the next level after the FastAPI practice and evaluation sequence above.

<p align="right"><a href="#top">↑ Back to top</a></p>

## Visual Callout Block Example for GitHub README

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recommended strategy:
>
> 1. Read the main materials in order.
> 2. Study the demo project carefully.
> 3. Build your own API by adaptation, not by improvisation.
> 4. Reuse the front-end patterns already analyzed.
> 5. Move to the next project only after completing the full sequence.
